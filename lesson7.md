# Lesson 7 - Submitting a Pull request

Learn how to submit a pull request to a team member to review code and accept changes to a branch.


## Step 1 - Create a new branch

`git checkout -b feature/lastName-lesson7`


## Step 2 - Update your file

On line 4 add "Lesson 7 - submitting a pull request"


## Step 3 - Add, commit, push to branch


## Step 4 - Create a pull request

At this point we've just used the command line, but for submiting a pull request we will go to our git implementation, Bitbucket web page.

## Step 5 - Craete a pull request

* Click on the icon on the left that says "Pull Request"
* Choose your feature branch as the source branch
* Choose master as the destination branch
* Leave a comment for team member (or yourself)
* Submit the pull request

## Step 6 - Accept pull request

Since the changes you made should have no conflicts with master, we should be able to automatically merge the updates from the feature branch to master just by accepting the pull request.

A pull request could also be used for discussion among developers for additional changes are code reviews.
